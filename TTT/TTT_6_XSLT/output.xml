               Prosopography: Wheaton Family Business and Financial Papers
                Built from names mentioned in documents in the Wheaton Family Papers MC001,
                  Marion B. Gebbie Archives and Special Collections at the Madeleine Clark Wallace
                  Library, Wheaton College. The first forty-one entries are based on Paine's
                  biography of Eliza Baylies Wheaton. Entries 42 through 92 are based on on
                  EBWdiaback file that was created by student researchers in 2005 and is used in
                  Eliza Baylies Wheaton Diaries published in TAPAS. Entries 93 through 134 are also
                  based on work of 2005 student researchers. Entries 135 and following are names
                  from Laban Morey Wheaton's Day Book. The purpose of the new file is to bring
                  supporting files for the Wheaton College Digital History Project into
                  compatibility with TEI P5. Begun by Kathryn Tomasek in

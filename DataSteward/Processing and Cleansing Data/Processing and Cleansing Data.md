## "Your data is bad and you should feel bad"

Maybe that's a phrase you'll use one day as a data steward. We all have to deal with bad, dirty and messy data. It is estimated that data scientists for example spend about 80% of their time cleaning data. Haven't found any evidence if this is true. But many articles about data cleaning and data prepreation starts with that number.

## Types of Error

Let's take a look at some of the most common errors. **Standardization and formatting** of strings, dates and numbers in a data set is a problem. This includes spaces, spelling, or dates, which can be a pain when working with data. We also have to deal with **missing values**. For example, a cell in a table is not filled in, but in the next row the data field is filled in again. The data may be optional or it may be an error in our data. Then there are the so-called **bad values**. A data point simply does not match with the record. For example, a year in George Washington's financial papers does not match with the other dates, or the price of the carrot is 180 € because, for example, a coma has gone lost. **Duplicates** in data are also a problem, of course. Not for every kind of processing, but when we want to count all records, for example, or when we want to enter our data into a database.

We will now look at examples of the most common errors and discuss some solutions on how to fix them using Google Spreadsheet, OpenRefine or Python.
